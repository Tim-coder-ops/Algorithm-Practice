The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones,
starting from 0 and 1. That is,

public int Fib(int N) {
        
    int result = 0;
    int previous = 1;
 
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        int temp = result;
        result = previous;
        previous = temp + previous;
    }
    return result;
    }
