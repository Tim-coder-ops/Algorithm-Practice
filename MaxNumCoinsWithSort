//You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
//Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
//Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
//Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.

//Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.
