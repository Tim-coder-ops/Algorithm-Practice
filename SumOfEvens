given a range of ints return the sum of all even ints
given the min and max number

input = 2-5 include min and max                               //10 - 15
                                                              
output = 6  

Signature that outputs an int and takes in 2 ints
create an int called result
for loop starting at the min and ending at the max
	check if number is even with mod
		if it is even add it to the result
return the result 


public static int GetEvenSum(int min, int max)
{
	int result = 0;
	
	for(int i = min; i <= max; i++)
	{
		if(i % 2 == 0) result += i;
	}
	
	return result;
}
